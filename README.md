# SharpFM

SharpFM is a cross platform (Mac, Windows, Linux) FileMaker Pro Developer Utility to help navigate migrating FileMaker code between FileMaker files. This means you can copy scripts, layouts, tables, etc across machine barriers like Remote Desktop, Citrix/XenApp or anything that can copy plain text between machines, save them for later, change them if you want, then finally re-paste them into the same or other FileMaker file.

## Features

- [x] Copy FileMaker Scripts, Tables, or Layouts From FileMaker Pro to their XML representation.
- [x] Edit raw FileMaker XML code (scripts, layouts, tables) with ability to paste changes back into FileMaker.
- [x] Use AvaloniaEdit for XML editing with syntax highlighting.
- [x] Persist FileMaker clips between SharpFM runs.
- [ ] Better UI tools to mutate the Raw XML.
